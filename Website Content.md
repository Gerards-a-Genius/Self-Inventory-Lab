**From Safety Nets to Self-Leadership**

---

For most of my life, I was a risk assessor. Plan B was my security blanket. Hypervigilance kept me three steps ahead — and completely disconnected from ease, presence, or possibility.

I built a successful corporate career, wore responsibility like a badge of honor, and rarely paused long enough to ask what *I* actually wanted. Dreaming felt risky. Rest felt irresponsible. Wanting more? That felt indulgent.

Everything shifted in 2017 after a life-altering event cracked me open. I finally asked the questions I had avoided for years:

*Whose story am I living? Why do I feel stuck? What do I want — and why don’t I have it?*

I began doing the deep work — exploring subconscious blocks, working with my inner parts, and reconnecting to my own internal authority. I became a manifestation coach with **To Be Magnetic**, guiding hundreds of people to clear their blocks and create aligned lives. But I knew something deeper was coming through.

That’s when I created the **Self Inventory Lab** and developed the **Insight Mapping System** — a personalized framework that blends **Human Design**, **IFS**, and **mindset coaching** to help clients shift from stuck to self-led.

*"Dreaming felt risky. Rest felt irresponsible. Self-inventory changed everything."*

Now, I help others do the same: clarify what’s really in the way, reframe their beliefs with compassion, and build momentum — one micro action at a time.

**What I Believe**

---

I believe the fastest way to get unstuck is to understand *who’s in the driver’s seat* — and whether that part of you is actually equipped to take you where you want to go.

We all have internal parts that react to discomfort: some try to control the outcome, others avoid it altogether. These protector parts aren’t wrong — they’re trying to keep us safe. But left unnamed, they’ll keep us spinning in the same patterns.

My coaching isn’t about digging endlessly into the past. It’s about identifying what’s making you stuck *right now,* mapping which part of you is leading, and using your **Human Design** to guide what happens next.

That’s where the **Insight Mapping System** comes in.

It’s a 3-phase framework:

1. **Take Inventory** of your Human Design, your beliefs, and your current internal landscape

2. **Detach from protector parts** (both proactive and reactive)

3. **Create an intentional roadmap** based on aligned, directionally right micro-actions

Every client receives a different combination of tools — I pull from Human Design, IFS, mindset reframes, nervous system work, and strategic coaching — but the throughline is always the same:  
 To help you stop reacting from protection and start moving from clarity.
