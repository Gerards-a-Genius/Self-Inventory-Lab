# Self-Inventory Lab Framework Integration

## Overview
This directory contains the organized integration of three powerful methodologies:
- **Internal Family Systems (IFS)** - Clinical framework for parts work and healing
- **Everything is Figureoutable (EIF)** - Empowerment philosophy for unstoppable problem-solving
- **Insight Mapping System (IMS)** - Structured approach to personal and professional transformation

## The Enhanced Six-Step Process

The integration of these frameworks creates an enhanced version of the core IMS Six-Step Process:

1. **Insight Gathering** (EIF + IFS Enhanced)
2. **Mapping & Analysis** (Somatic + Systems Enhanced)  
3. **Strategy Development** (Collaborative Parts + EIF Research)
4. **Implementation** (Self-Leadership + Action Bias)
5. **Obstacle Navigation** (Parts-Informed + Figureoutable Solutions)
6. **Integration & Optimization** (Sustainable Change + Community)

See `six-step-process-enhanced.md` for complete details.

## Key Integration Principles

### 1. Multi-Level Approach
- **Mental**: Cognitive patterns and beliefs (EIF mindset shifts)
- **Emotional**: Parts work and internal family dynamics (IFS)
- **Somatic**: Body-based awareness and regulation
- **Behavioral**: Practical action and implementation (IMS structure)
- **Relational**: Community support and connection

### 2. Root Cause + Symptom Focus
- **IFS**: Addresses underlying parts and trauma that create patterns
- **EIF**: Provides empowering mindset for approaching any challenge
- **IMS**: Creates structured path for sustainable transformation

### 3. Clinical Rigor + Practical Application
- Evidence-based therapeutic principles (IFS)
- Tested empowerment philosophy (EIF)
- Systematic coaching methodology (IMS)

## Getting Started

### For Individuals:
1. **Foundation** (Weeks 1-2): Learn basic IFS concepts and adopt EIF mindset

3. **Implementation** (Weeks 5-8): Apply integrated strategies with parts awareness
4. **Mastery** (Weeks 9-12): Develop sustainable practices and community connection

### For Professionals:
1. **Personal Work**: Complete your own integration process first
2. **Training**: Seek additional education in IFS and somatic practices
3. **Application**: Adapt frameworks to client needs and contexts
4. **Supervision**: Maintain ongoing support and consultation
