# Everything is Figureoutable: Core Principles from Marie Forleo

## Origin Story: The Tropicana Orange Radio

Marie Forleo's mother embodies the figureoutable philosophy. Growing up in poverty in Newark, New Jersey, with alcoholic parents, she learned resourcefulness by necessity. The story of the Tropicana orange-shaped radio that her mother fixed, along with roofing repairs, bathroom retiling, and countless other DIY projects, illustrates the core principle.

When young Marie asked her mother: "How do you know how to do so many different things that you've never done before without anyone showing you how to do it?"

Her mother's response became the foundation: **"Don't be silly, Rhi. Nothing in life is that complicated. You can do whatever you set your mind to if you just roll up your sleeves, get in there and do it. Everything is figureoutable."**

## The Foundational Philosophy

### Core Belief Statement
"Everything is figureoutable" - This simple phrase and philosophy becomes the most powerful driving force for approaching any challenge, goal, or dream.

### The Power of Belief
- **Everything is created twice**: First in thought, then in reality
- **Beliefs shape reality**: What we believe deeply becomes what we achieve
- **The ancestor of every action is a thought** (Ralph Waldo Emerson)

## The Three Rules of Play

### Rule #1: All problems or dreams are figureoutable

This rule applies to virtually everything we encounter in life. If it exists as a challenge or aspiration, there is a way to figure it out.

### Rule #2: If a problem is not figureoutable, it's not really a problem - it's a fact of life or a law of nature

Examples include:
- Death
- Gravity  
- Other natural laws and physics

These are not problems to solve but realities to accept and work within.

### Rule #3: You may not care enough to figure this problem out or achieve this particular dream

**That's okay.** Find another problem or dream that ignites a blazing fire in your heart and go back to Rule #1.

This rule acknowledges that not every possible challenge needs to be your challenge. Focus your energy on what truly matters to you.

## The Roadmap to Results: 5 Essential Steps

### 1. Train Your Brain for Growth

Transform destructive thought patterns into productive questions:

**Destructive Thought #1**: "I know this already"
**Productive Reframe**: "What can I learn from this?"

The brain will always find ways to learn when you ask this question:
- New angles to familiar concepts
- Realizing you're not fully executing what you "know"
- The difference between intellectual knowledge and practical mastery

**Destructive Thought #2**: "This won't work for me"  
**Productive Reframe**: "How can this work for me?"

This forces you to:
- Think about possibilities rather than limitations
- Stretch outside cognitive comfort zones
- Find new connections and innovations

### 2. Try It Before You Deny It

**Key Principle**: Don't dismiss ideas without testing them first.

Three Rules of Play create a framework for staying open:
- Focus on what's actually figureoutable rather than looking for exceptions
- Test approaches for at least 30 days before making judgments
- Ask "What would someone creative do here?" when stuck

**Question to ask**: "Can you think of a more empowering and pragmatic philosophy to embrace than 'everything is figureoutable'?"

### 3. Don't Get Offended (Stay Open-Minded)

- Keep focus on growth rather than comfort
- Don't let surface-level differences distract from valuable content
- Remember: "What can I learn from this? How can this work for me?"

### 4. Do The Work

**The Action Imperative**: "Insight without action is worthless. Taking action is the only path to change."

Key principles:
- Complete exercises with full effort and commitment
- Don't just think about challenges - write responses by hand
- Writing by hand helps you learn, understand, and retain information more effectively
- Writing by hand forces your brain to slow down and access deeper truths

**30-Day Commitment**: Experiment with ideas and suggestions for at least 30 days of daily, good-faith practice before making judgments.

### 5. Connect with Community

**Principle**: The figureoutable philosophy becomes geometrically more powerful when applied in collaboration with others.

Benefits:
- Reach goals faster
- Greater sense of joy, creativity, and camaraderie  
- Collective wisdom and support
- Shared accountability and encouragement

## The Unstoppable Mindset

Being "unstoppable" through the figureoutable philosophy doesn't mean:
- Everything will always go your way (it won't)
- You'll never face disappointment, rejection, or defeat (you definitely will)
- Life will be easy or without challenges

Being unstoppable means:
- **Nothing, no thing, no person, no fear, no limitation, no circumstance will ever again have the power to hold you back**
- Every obstacle becomes a puzzle to solve
- Setbacks become temporary rather than permanent
- You maintain agency and power in every situation

## Neuroplasticity and Repetition

**Key Principle**: Repetition is essential for rewiring the brain and turning good ideas into permanent new ways of being and behaving.

The figureoutable philosophy is designed as a spiral path:
- You'll encounter similar issues at different levels
- Each repetition deepens understanding and integration
- Simple principles become elegant and efficient solutions
- A handful of tools and tenets alter life trajectory

## David Deutsch Quote Integration

"Everything that is not forbidden by laws of nature is achievable, given the right knowledge."

This quantum physics principle aligns perfectly with the figureoutable philosophy:
- If it's not a natural law, it's figureoutable
- The key is gaining the right knowledge through exploration and experimentation
- Human creativity and problem-solving capacity is virtually limitless within natural laws

## Practical Daily Integration

### Morning Practices
- Declare: "Today I will figure out [specific challenge]"
- Ask: "What can I figure out today that will move me forward?"
- Set intention to approach obstacles with curiosity rather than defeat

### Throughout the Day
- When facing challenges, immediately reframe: "How might I figure this out?"
- Research and seek examples of others who've solved similar problems
- Take small experimental actions rather than waiting for perfect solutions

### Evening Reflection  
- "What did I figure out today?"
- "What challenged my figureoutable belief and how can I reframe it?"
- "What will I figure out tomorrow?"

This philosophy becomes a complete operating system for approaching life with confidence, creativity, and unstoppable momentum toward any goal or dream.
