# Human Design Centers and Definition

## Overview

The Human Design bodygraph contains 9 Centers, which are energy hubs that process and transmit different types of energy. Centers can be Defined (colored in) or Undefined/Open (white), determining whether you have consistent access to that energy or sample it from others.

## Understanding Definition

### What Definition Means

**Defined Centers (Colored):**
- Consistent energy
- You broadcast this energy
- Others feel this from you
- Your gifts to share
- Fixed way of operating

**Undefined Centers (White):**
- Inconsistent energy
- You receive and amplify
- Where you're influenced
- Your wisdom areas
- Flexible and adaptive

### The Conditioning Process

**Open Centers are where we:**

- Develop false beliefs
- Can develop wisdom
- Experience inconsistency

**Common Conditioning Patterns:**

## Centers and Authority

### How Centers Determine Authority

The hierarchy of definition determines your authority:

1. **Solar Plexus Defined** = Emotional Authority
2. **Sacral Defined** (Solar Plexus undefined) = Sacral Authority
3. **Spleen Defined** (Sacral & Solar Plexus undefined) = Splenic Authority
4. **Heart Defined** (Sacral, Solar Plexus & Spleen undefined) = Ego Authority
5. **G Center Defined** (all below undefined) = Self-Projected Authority
6. **Mind/Ajna Defined** (all below undefined) = Environmental Authority
7. **No Centers Defined** = Lunar Authority (Reflectors)

---

## Practical Applications

### Working with Your Definition

**For Defined Centers:**
1. Trust your consistent energy
2. Share your gifts
3. Don't doubt your fixed nature
4. Understand you impact others

**For Undefined Centers:**

2. Release others' energy
3. Develop wisdom

### In Relationships

**Electromagnetic Connections:**
- When two people have adjacent undefined centers

**Companionship:**
- Same centers defined
- Understand each other
- Similar operating system
- Can lack spark

**Dominance:**
- One has defined, other undefined
