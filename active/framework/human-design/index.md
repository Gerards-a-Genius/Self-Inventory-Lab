## How to Use These Resources

### For Practitioners/Coaches

1. **Start with Types** - Understanding the five types is foundational
2. **Layer in Authorities** - Each type can have specific authorities
3. **Integrate Strategy** - Show how strategy and authority work together
4. **Use PDFs for Visual Learning** - Great for client sessions
5. **Reference Specific Sections** - Each document is comprehensively indexed

### For Self-Study

1. **Identify Your Type First** - Read the relevant section in energy-types.md
2. **Find Your Authority** - Locate your specific authority in inner-authorities.md
3. **Understand Your Strategy** - Study your type's strategy in strategy-decision-making.md
4. **Practice Daily** - Use the practical tools and exercises provided
5. **Track Your Experience** - Notice alignment and misalignment patterns

### For Integration with Self-Inventory Lab

1. **Client Profiling** - Use type and authority for initial assessment
2. **Decision Support** - Guide clients through their authority
3. **Strategy Coaching** - Help clients implement their strategy
4. **Relationship Dynamics** - Understand type interactions
5. **Team Composition** - Balance types in group settings

## Key Concepts Summary

### The Human Design System Components

1. **Type** - Your energetic blueprint and role
2. **Strategy** - How you're designed to interact with life
3. **Authority** - Your decision-making mechanism
4. **Centers** - Energy hubs (defined/undefined)
5. **Profile** - Your personality archetype
6. **Gates & Channels** - Specific gifts and connections

### Core Principles

- **No type is better than another** - Each has a vital role
- **Strategy reduces resistance** - Working with your design, not against it
- **Authority trumps mind** - Body wisdom over mental reasoning
- **Correctness is personal** - What's right for you may not be right for others
- **Conditioning exists** - We can act like other types under pressure
- **Deconditioning takes time** - Usually 7 years for cellular renewal
