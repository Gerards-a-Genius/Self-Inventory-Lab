# Human Design Inner Authorities

## Overview

Your Inner Authority is your internal compass - the reliable, trustworthy tool that leads you down your perfect path. It's how you're designed to make aligned decisions that are correct for you. Our mind is not meant to be the seat of decision-making; instead, we have a body-based authority that provides clear guidance.
