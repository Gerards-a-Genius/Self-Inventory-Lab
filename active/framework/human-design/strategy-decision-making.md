# Human Design Strategy & Decision Making

## Overview

In Human Design, Strategy and Authority work together as a decision-making framework. Strategy shows you HOW opportunities come into your life, while Authority tells you WHICH opportunities are correct for you. This combination creates a personalized navigation system for life.

## The Strategy-Authority Relationship

### General Flow (Most Types)
1. **Strategy First**: Opportunity appears according to your Type's strategy
2. **Authority Second**: Use your authority to assess if it's correct
3. **Action**: Move forward only with aligned decisions

### Exception: Manifestors
1. **Authority First**: Feel into the urge using your authority
2. **Strategy Second**: Inform those impacted before taking action
3. **Action**: Initiate with reduced resistance

## Strategy by Type

### Generators: Wait to Respond

**How Life Comes to You**
- Through external stimuli
- Things showing up in your reality
- Conversations, opportunities, ideas
- Not through mental initiation

**The Response**
- Gut reaction to what appears
- Physical sensation of yes/no
- Energy rising or falling
- No mental reasoning needed

**Practical Application**
- Stay open and aware
- Let life bring options
- Feel your gut response
- Only pursue clear "yes" responses
- Course-correct as needed

**What to Respond To**
- Job postings that catch your eye
- Invitations from others
- Ideas in conversation
- Content that sparks interest
- Opportunities that appear

### Manifesting Generators: Wait to Respond & Inform

**Unique Hybrid Strategy**
- Respond like a Generator
- Inform like a Manifestor
- Multi-passionate approach
- Non-linear path

**The Process**
1. Something appears in your world
2. Gut responds with interest
3. Visualize doing it
4. If still excited, inform others
5. Take action and adjust as you go

**Key Differences**
- Faster than pure Generators
- Skip steps naturally
- Multiple interests simultaneously
- Need to inform to reduce resistance
- Course-correction is normal

**Informing for MGs**
- "Heads up, I'm going to..."
- Keep key people in loop
- Reduces resistance significantly
- Not asking permission
- Simply sharing direction

### Projectors: Wait for the Invitation

**What Requires an Invitation**

- Career opportunities
- Romantic relationships
- Where to live
- Sharing your gifts

**What Doesn't Require Invitation**
- Personal interests and hobbies
- Self-study and mastery

**Types of Invitations**

**Formal Invitations:**
- "Would you like to..."
- "Can you help me with..."
- "I'd love your perspective on..."
- Job offers
- Relationship proposals

**Energetic Invitations:**
- Feeling genuinely seen
- Recognition of your gifts
- Curiosity about your perspective
- Space made for your wisdom
- Appreciation of uniqueness

**Creating Invitation Opportunities**

**Assessing Invitations**
- Do I feel recognized?
- Are my specific gifts seen?
- Is there genuine appreciation?
- Does this energize or drain me?
- Is there space for my wisdom?
