# IFS Self-Therapy Guide: Working with Your Internal Family

*Based on "Self-therapy with the IFS method" by Michał Pasterski and integrated with IMS principles*

## Understanding the Internal Family Systems Model

### The Paradigm Shift: From "Monomind" to "Multiple Mind"
Traditional psychology often treats the mind as a single, unified entity. IFS recognizes that we naturally have multiple parts or subpersonalities that make up our internal experience. This isn't pathological—it's a normal, healthy aspect of human psychology.

**Key Insight**: "When we see our mind as a one whole, every weakness and vice will be equated with our 'self'. When we recognize our natural multiplicity, we can work with specific parts while maintaining Self-leadership."

### The Three Types of Parts

#### 1. Exiles
**Characteristics**:
- Carry childhood emotional wounds and trauma
- Often frozen in time at the age when hurt occurred
- Hold feelings like grief, fear, shame, loneliness
- Need healing, comfort, and understanding

**Common Exile Parts**:
- The Abandoned Child
- The Rejected One  
- The Misunderstood One
- The Powerless One
- The Invisible One

**IMS Integration**: Exile parts often drive the deepest patterns we see in assessment work. Understanding and healing these parts creates lasting transformation.

#### 2. Managers
**Characteristics**:
- Protective parts that try to keep us safe
- Work to prevent activation of exile parts
- Often developed in childhood as survival strategies
- Can become rigid and controlling over time

**Common Manager Parts**:
- **The Controller**: Wants control over everything to prevent emotional pain
- **The Perfectionist**: Believes if everything is perfect, we won't be rejected
- **The Passive Pessimist**: Avoids connection to prevent rejection
- **The Caregiver**: Takes care of everyone else to avoid abandonment
- **The Achiever**: Drives toward success to prove worthiness

**IMS Integration**: Manager parts often create the behavioral patterns and obstacles we identify in IMS work. They need appreciation and new, healthier roles rather than elimination.

#### 3. Firefighters  
**Characteristics**:
- Emergency response parts that activate when exiles are triggered
- React to pain with immediate soothing or distraction behaviors
- Often seen as "addictive" or "impulsive" behaviors
- Actually trying to help by numbing pain quickly

**Common Firefighter Behaviors**:
- Substance use (alcohol, drugs, food)
- Compulsive behaviors (shopping, sex, work)
- Escape behaviors (binge-watching, social media)
- Acting out (anger, rebellion, risk-taking)

**IMS Integration**: Firefighter behaviors often represent the "symptoms" people want to change in IMS work. Understanding their protective function helps create lasting change.

### The Self: Your Core Leadership
**The Self** is not another part—it's your essential core, characterized by the 8 C's:

1. **Compassion**: Natural kindness toward all parts
2. **Clarity**: Clear perspective on situations
3. **Calmness**: Peaceful presence even in difficulty
4. **Curiosity**: Genuine interest in understanding
5. **Confidence**: Quiet assurance in your capabilities
6. **Courage**: Willingness to face difficult truths
7. **Creativity**: Ability to find new solutions
8. **Connectedness**: Sense of belonging and purpose

## Self-Therapy Process: The Six Steps

### Step 1: Discovering Parts of Self
**Goal**: Develop awareness of your internal parts

**Practice**: Daily Thoughts and Feelings Tracking
- Throughout the day, ask: "How am I feeling right now?"
- "What am I thinking right now?"
- Notice patterns: Same part influencing you in multiple ways?
- Group similar thoughts/feelings and name the parts

**Example**:
- Thoughts like "Just do it already!" + "Try harder" + feelings of pressure = "Pusher Part"
- Thoughts like "What if something goes wrong?" + anxiety = "Worried Part"

**IMS Integration**: This awareness work enhances the insight-gathering phase of IMS by adding the parts perspective to pattern recognition.

### Step 2: Gathering Information on Your Inner Parts
For each identified part, explore these questions:

1. How do you feel about this part?
2. How does it affect you in your everyday life?
3. How often does it show up?
4. To what extent can you control it?
5. To what extent does it control you?
6. How would you like your relationship with this part to change?
7. Is it an exile, manager, or firefighter?

**Additional Observation Questions**:
- When and where is that part activated?
- How does its activity affect you physically and emotionally?
- To what extent are you able to calm it down?

### Step 3: Making Contact with Parts
**Preparation**:
1. Pick one part from your list
2. Sit comfortably and close your eyes
3. Take deep breaths to calm yourself
4. Direct attention inward to your body
5. Give yourself time to connect with the emotions/thoughts of this part

**The Dialogue Process**:
6. Check if your imagination creates any image of this part
7. Approach the part with curiosity, calmness, and openness
8. If you feel afraid/angry toward the part, ask those judging parts to step aside
9. Make contact: "Are you aware I'm here? Do you know you're there?"
10. Let the part speak: "What do you want to tell me?"
11. Ask about its role: "Why is it there? Why does it affect you this way?"
12. Appreciate the part: Thank it for its efforts and intentions
13. Ask what it needs: "What would have to happen for you to stop this behavior?"
14. Ask if it wants to add anything else
15. Give what the part needs right away (if possible)
16. Say thanks and goodbye

### Step 4: Building Relationship and Trust
**Key Principles**:
- Approach parts with genuine curiosity rather than trying to change them
- Appreciate each part's positive intention
- Listen without judgment
- Keep commitments you make to parts

**Trust-Building Actions**:
- Check in regularly with parts that need attention
- Follow through on promises made during dialogue
- Defend parts against internal criticism
- Include parts' perspectives in decision-making

### Step 5: Parts Integration and New Roles
Once you have a relationship with a part:

1. **Acknowledge the part's history**: "I see how hard you've worked to protect me"
2. **Assess current relevance**: "Is this role still needed in the same way?"
3. **Negotiate new roles**: "How would you like to contribute now?"
4. **Support the transition**: Provide what the part needs to feel safe changing
5. **Regular check-ins**: Maintain ongoing relationship as part adapts

**Example Transformations**:
- Anxious Manager → Helpful Planner
- Critical Manager → Wise Advisor  
- Perfectionist Manager → Excellence Supporter
- Workaholic Firefighter → Passionate Creator

### Step 6: Self-Leadership Development
**Daily Self-Leadership Practices**:

**Morning Check-in** (10 minutes):
- "How is Self showing up today?"
- "What parts need attention?"
- "How can I lead from Self in my day?"

**Midday Reset** (5 minutes):
- "Which parts have been active?"
- "How can I return to Self-leadership?"
- Make any needed course corrections

**Evening Integration** (15 minutes):
- "What did I learn about my parts today?"
- Appreciate parts for their efforts
- Plan how to apply Self-leadership tomorrow

## Advanced Self-Therapy Practices

### Working with Exile Parts
**Special Considerations**:
- Go slowly—exiles have been hurt and may be scared
- Always get permission from manager parts first
- Provide safety and protection before asking exiles to share

5. Provide comfort and reassurance
6. Help exile update their understanding of current reality
7. Invite exile into current life in age-appropriate ways

### Working with Manager Parts
**Appreciation-Based Approach**:
1. Acknowledge the part's important job
2. Thank the part for its dedication and hard work
3. Ask what the part is afraid will happen if it stops its job
4. Address those fears directly
5. Negotiate new, less burdensome roles
6. Provide support during transition

### Working with Firefighter Parts
**Understanding the Emergency**:
1. Recognize firefighters as protective, not destructive
2. Find out which exile the firefighter is trying to help
3. Provide alternative ways to comfort the exile
4. Give firefighter parts new roles that channel their energy positively
