# Somatic IFS Practices: Embodied Parts Work for the Insight Mapping System

*Based on LaDonna Silva's Somatic Parts Work materials and integration with IMS*

## Overview of Somatic IFS

Somatic Internal Family Systems therapy combines traditional IFS with body-based awareness and practices. This approach recognizes that our parts are not just mental concepts but are held and expressed through our bodies, nervous system, and energetic presence.

## The Five Practices of Somatic IFS

### 1. Awareness (Earth Element - Foundation)
**Purpose**: Building awareness inside ourselves and getting to know our parts

**Practices**:
- **Grounding Connection**: Feel your connection to earth, roots, anchor, center
- **Body Scanning**: Notice where different parts are held in your body
- **Parts Location**: "Where do I feel my Anxious Part? My Critical Part?"

**IMS Integration**:
- Use awareness practices during IMS assessment phases
- Ground yourself before difficult insight work
- Create embodied connection to your internal system

### 2. Breath (Air Element - Life Force)
**Purpose**: Supporting connection to spaciousness and vertical alignment

**Practices**:
- **Conscious Breathing**: Use breath to support connection between parts
- **Parts Breathing**: Breathe with specific parts that need attention
- **Nervous System Regulation**: Breath as a tool for Self-leadership

**IMS Integration**:
- Begin each IMS session with intentional breathing
- Use breath to stay present during challenging insights
- Teach clients breath practices for ongoing self-regulation

### 3. Resonance (Water Element - Connection)
**Purpose**: Connection with relationships inside our system and with others

**Practices**:
- **Internal Resonance**: Feeling the relationship between Self and parts
- **System Resonance**: Using your internal awareness to sense others' parts
- **Therapeutic Resonance**: Staying embodied while working with clients

**IMS Integration**:
- Notice which parts get activated during coaching sessions
- Use resonance to sense when clients' parts are taking over
- Maintain Self-led presence throughout the IMS process

### 4. Movement (Fire Element - Transformation)
**Purpose**: Honoring the body's need to move and express

**Practices**:
- **Parts Movement**: Allow parts to express through movement
- **Trauma Release**: Movement to support exile healing
- **Energy Circulation**: Moving energy through the system

**IMS Integration**:
- Include movement breaks during long IMS sessions
- Use movement to help process insights
- Allow clients to move during parts work if needed

### 5. Touch (Heart Element - Compassion)
**Purpose**: Bringing heart energy and compassion into healing

**Types of Touch**:
- **Self-Touch**: Placing hands on parts of body that need comfort
- **Imaginary Touch**: Visualized comfort for parts
- **Therapeutic Touch**: When appropriate and consensual

**IMS Integration**:
- Teach self-touch practices for parts comfort
- Use heart-centered presence during difficult parts work
- Model compassionate touch with your own parts

## Somatic Parts Assessment

### Physical Parts Mapping

### Nervous System Patterns
**Sympathetic Activation** (Manager/Firefighter patterns):
- Racing heart, shallow breathing
- Muscle tension, hypervigilance
- Urgency, restlessness

**Dorsal Shutdown** (Exile patterns):
- Fatigue, numbness
- Disconnection, fogginess
- Depression, collapse

**Ventral Engagement** (Self-leadership):

## Professional Guidelines

### For IMS Practitioners
- Complete your own somatic parts work first
- Maintain appropriate boundaries with touch
