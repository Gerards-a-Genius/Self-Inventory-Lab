# The Six-Step Process of the Insight Mapping System (Enhanced with Everything is Figureoutable)

## Overview
The Six-Step Process represents the core methodology of the Insight Mapping System (IMS), now enhanced with Marie Forleo's "Everything is Figureoutable" philosophy and Internal Family Systems principles. This integration creates a comprehensive framework for deep personal transformation.

## The Enhanced Six-Step Process

### Step 1: Insight Gathering (EIF + IFS Enhanced)
**Traditional Focus**: Pattern recognition and awareness building
**EIF Enhancement**: "What patterns can I figure out how to shift?"
**IFS Enhancement**: "Which parts of me create these patterns?"

#### Core Activities:
1. **Pattern Recognition with Parts Awareness**
   - Daily tracking: "Which part is showing up right now?"
   - Emotional patterns: "What part feels this way?"
   - Behavioral patterns: "What part drives this behavior?"

2. **EIF-Enhanced Questions**:
   - Instead of: "I keep repeating this pattern"
   - Ask: "How can I figure out what drives this pattern?"
   - Instead of: "This pattern is just who I am"  
   - Ask: "What would I attempt if I knew this was figureoutable?"

3. **Integration Process**:
   - Map patterns to specific parts (Manager, Exile, Firefighter)
   - Apply figureoutable mindset to each pattern
   - Research others who've shifted similar patterns

#### Daily Practice:
- Morning: "What parts need attention today and how is this figureoutable?"
- Throughout day: Track part activation and figureoutable solutions
- Evening: "What did I figure out about my patterns today?"

### Step 2: Mapping & Analysis (Somatic + Systems Enhanced)
**Traditional Focus**: Visual representation of challenges and connections
**EIF Enhancement**: Add "figureoutable solutions" layer to every map
**IFS Enhancement**: Map internal parts relationships and dynamics

#### Enhanced Mapping Process:
1. **Multi-Layer Mapping**:
   - **Surface Layer**: Behaviors and symptoms
   - **Parts Layer**: Which parts drive these behaviors
   - **Root Layer**: What exiles need healing
   - **Solutions Layer**: How everything is figureoutable
   - **Resources Layer**: Who has figured out similar challenges

2. **Somatic Mapping**:
   - Map parts to body locations and sensations
   - Include nervous system activation patterns
   - Identify physical resources and strengths

3. **Systems Mapping**:
   - Family/relationship system influences
   - Parts interactions and conflicts
   - Self-leadership opportunities

#### Mapping Tools:
- **Parts Family Tree**: Visual representation of internal system
- **Figureoutable Solutions Web**: Connected solutions and approaches  
- **Body-Parts Map**: Physical locations and sensations
- **Trigger-Response Cycle**: How parts get activated and respond

### Step 3: Strategy Development (Collaborative Parts + EIF Research)
**Traditional Focus**: Creating action plans and approaches
**EIF Enhancement**: "How can I figure out the most effective approaches?"
**IFS Enhancement**: "What do all parts need for this strategy to work?"

#### Enhanced Strategy Process:
1. **Parts Council Meeting**:
   - Gather input from all relevant parts
   - Address internal resistance and concerns
   - Create unified vision that honors all parts

2. **EIF Research Protocol**:
   - Find 3-5 people who've figured out similar challenges
   - Study their approaches and adapt to your situation
   - Identify specific tactics to test

3. **Somatic Integration**:
   - Ensure strategies feel good in your body
   - Include nervous system regulation practices
   - Plan for supporting parts through change

#### Strategy Components:
- **Parts-Informed Goals**: What each part wants from this process
- **Figureoutable Action Steps**: Specific tactics to test and adapt
- **Support Systems**: Professional help, community, accountability
- **Integration Practices**: Daily habits to reinforce changes

### Step 4: Implementation (Self-Leadership + Action Bias)
**Traditional Focus**: Taking consistent action steps  
**EIF Enhancement**: "What specific steps can I figure out to guarantee progress?"
**IFS Enhancement**: "How can I maintain Self-leadership throughout implementation?"

#### Enhanced Implementation Framework:
1. **Self-Leadership First**:
   - Begin each day from Self rather than parts
   - Use 8 C's assessment when making decisions
   - Maintain parts appreciation throughout process

2. **EIF Action Bias**:
   - Take experimental actions rather than waiting for certainty
   - "Try it before you deny it" approach to new strategies
   - Focus on learning over perfection

3. **Parts Support During Change**:
   - Regular check-ins with parts about how changes feel
   - Provide extra comfort to parts during transition
   - Address resistance with curiosity rather than force

#### Daily Implementation Practice:
- **Morning Self-Leadership Check**: "How can I lead from Self today?"
- **Midday Parts Check**: "Which parts need support right now?"
- **Evening Integration**: "What did I figure out about change today?"

### Step 5: Obstacle Navigation (Parts-Informed + Figureoutable Solutions)
**Traditional Focus**: Working through challenges and resistance
**EIF Enhancement**: "Every obstacle is figureoutable—what creative approaches can I try?"
**IFS Enhancement**: "Which parts create obstacles and what do they need?"

#### Enhanced Obstacle Navigation:
1. **Parts-Based Resistance Analysis**:
   - Which part is creating the resistance?
   - What is this part afraid will happen?
   - How can I address the part's concerns?

2. **EIF Obstacle Transformation**:
   - Level 1: "This obstacle is figureoutable"
   - Level 2: "Who has figured out this exact challenge?"  
   - Level 3: "What would I try if I couldn't fail?"

3. **Somatic Obstacle Work**:
   - Where is resistance held in the body?
   - What does the body need to move through this?
   - How can movement support breakthrough?

#### Obstacle Navigation Protocols:
- **The Parts Dialogue**: Understanding internal resistance
- **The Research Sprint**: Finding examples of others who've overcome similar obstacles
- **The Experiment Design**: Creating small tests to move forward
- **The Support Activation**: Getting help from people, parts, and resources

### Step 6: Integration & Optimization (Sustainable Change + Community)
**Traditional Focus**: Maintaining changes and continuous improvement
**EIF Enhancement**: "How can I figure out even better approaches for sustained success?"
**IFS Enhancement**: "How can I maintain ongoing Self-leadership and parts harmony?"

#### Enhanced Integration Process:
1. **Deep Change Integration**:
   - Parts work to ensure all parts support new patterns
   - Somatic practices to embody changes
   - Nervous system rewiring through consistent practice

2. **Continuous Figureoutable Optimization**:
   - Monthly "How can this work even better?" reviews
   - Research new approaches and innovations
   - Experiment with advanced techniques

3. **Community Integration**:
   - Share success stories and support others
   - Learn from community experiences
   - Contribute to collective figureoutable wisdom

#### Sustainability Practices:
- **Daily**: Parts check-ins and Self-leadership practices
- **Weekly**: Review progress and optimize approaches
- **Monthly**: Deep integration work and strategy updates
- **Quarterly**: Community sharing and advanced learning
