    <!-- Heather's Story -->
    <section class="section">
        <div class="container">
            <h2>From Safety Nets to Self-Leadership</h2>
            <div class="story-content">
                <p>For most of my life, I was a risk assessor. Plan B was my security blanket. Hypervigilance kept me three steps ahead â€” and completely disconnected from ease, presence, or possibility.</p>
                
                <p>I built a successful corporate career, wore responsibility like a badge of honor, and rarely paused long enough to ask what <em>I</em> actually wanted. Dreaming felt risky. Rest felt irresponsible. Wanting more? That felt indulgent.</p>
                
                <p>Everything shifted in 2017 after a life-altering event cracked me open. I finally asked the questions I had avoided for years:</p>
                
                <p><em>Whose story am I living? Why do I feel stuck? What do I want â€” and why don't I have it?</em></p>
                
                <p>I began doing the deep work â€” exploring subconscious blocks, working with my inner parts, and reconnecting to my own internal authority. I became a manifestation coach with <strong>To Be Magnetic</strong>, guiding hundreds of people to clear their blocks and create aligned lives. But I knew something deeper was coming through.</p>
                
                <p>That's when I created the <strong>Self Inventory Lab</strong> and developed the <strong>Insight Mapping System</strong> â€” a personalized framework that blends <strong>Human Design</strong>, <strong>IFS</strong>, and <strong>mindset coaching</strong> to help clients shift from stuck to self-led.</p>
                
                <blockquote class="highlight-quote">
                    <p>"Dreaming felt risky. Rest felt irresponsible. Self-inventory changed everything."</p>
                </blockquote>
                
                <p>Now, I help others do the same: clarify what's really in the way, reframe their beliefs with compassion, and build momentum â€” one micro action at a time.</p>

    <!-- What I Believe -->

            <h2>What I Believe</h2>
            <div class="belief-content">
                <p>I believe the fastest way to get unstuck is to understand <em>who's in the driver's seat</em> â€” and whether that part of you is actually equipped to take you where you want to go.</p>
                
                <p>We all have internal parts that react to discomfort: some try to control the outcome, others avoid it altogether. These protector parts aren't wrong â€” they're trying to keep us safe. But left unnamed, they'll keep us spinning in the same patterns.</p>
                
                <p>My coaching isn't about digging endlessly into the past. It's about identifying what's making you stuck <em>right now,</em> mapping which part of you is leading, and using your <strong>Human Design</strong> to guide what happens next.</p>
                
                <p>That's where the <strong>Insight Mapping System</strong> comes in.</p>
                
                <p>It's a 3-phase framework:</p>
                
                <ol class="framework-list">
                    <li><strong>Take Inventory</strong> of your Human Design, your beliefs, and your current internal landscape</li>
                    <li><strong>Detach from protector parts</strong> (both proactive and reactive)</li>
                    <li><strong>Create an intentional roadmap</strong> based on aligned, directionally right micro-actions</li>
                </ol>
                
                <p>Every client receives a different combination of tools â€” I pull from Human Design, IFS, mindset reframes, nervous system work, and strategic coaching â€” but the throughline is always the same:<br>
                To help you stop reacting from protection and start moving from clarity.</p>
