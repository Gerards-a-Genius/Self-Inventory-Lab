                <h2>Why Most Personal Growth Doesn't Stick</h2>
                <p style="max-width: 700px; margin: 0 auto;">Most programs give you more information—when what you actually need is <strong>integration</strong>. The Insight Mapping System™ doesn't just help you understand yourself on paper—it helps you live it, in your body and in your daily choices.</p>

                    <h3>The Problem</h3>
                    <p>You've done the work. You know yourself well. But despite all that awareness, you're still running into the same blocks. You know what you "should" do—yet it's hard to do it consistently without burning out or losing momentum.</p>

                    <p>Lasting change isn't just about mindset—it's about alignment. You have to address the protective parts that keep you playing small and reconnect to your natural energetic design so your actions feel effortless, not forced.</p>

                            <p>Before you can change anything, you need to understand how you're uniquely designed to operate—not just in theory, but in how you actually move through the world.</p>
                            
                            <p>Your Human Design is your energetic blueprint—it shows your most natural way of making decisions, using your energy, and navigating life. It reveals your innate strengths, your sensitivities, and the places you've been conditioned to act against your nature.</p>
                            
                            <p>This isn't just intellectual knowledge—it's about feeling the truth of your design in your body and letting that guide your choices.</p>

                                <li>Your defined centers – the parts of you that hold consistent energy, your built-in strengths and ways of showing up</li>

                            <p>Most people try to change their habits without realizing who inside them is actually making the decisions.</p>
                            
                            <p>In the Insight Mapping System™, we focus on just two protector roles—because these are the ones most often in the driver's seat:</p>
                            
                            <ul class="service-features">
                                <li><strong>The Manager</strong> – proactive, always trying to plan, prevent, or control outcomes.</li>
                                <li><strong>The Firefighter</strong> – reactive, rushing in to numb, distract, or escape discomfort.</li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <p>Here's the difference: we don't just identify these parts in a generic way. We name them specifically for you—based on:</p>
                            
                            <ul class="service-features">

                            </ul>
                            
                            <p>By giving these parts personal names tied to your unique patterns, you can quickly recognize when they've taken the wheel. Awareness is what makes detachment possible.</p>
                            
                            <h4>What You'll Discover:</h4>

                            <p>Once you've reconnected to your Self and quieted the noise from your protectors, it's time to turn that clarity into movement. In this step, we focus on building a Roadmap of Intention—practical, directionally right micro-actions designed to move you forward right now, even if you've been feeling frozen.</p>
                            
                            <p>Using a curated mix of decision-making tools—your Human Design Authority, proven frameworks, and real-time awareness—you'll learn how to take steps that are both aligned and doable. This isn't about overhauling your life overnight. It's about creating momentum with small, intentional moves that add up to big change.</p>

                <p>This isn't a "fingers crossed" approach to personal growth. It gives you a clear, repeatable process for becoming self-led—rooted in your Human Design blueprint, targeted parts work, and intentional micro-actions that move the needle.</p>

                    <h3>1. Your Design as the Manual</h3>
