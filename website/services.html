                    <p>The Becoming You Method, developed by Professor Suzy Welch, is built on the idea that your purpose lives at the intersection of three things: what you want to do, what you can do, and what you should do. In other words—your values, your aptitudes, and the areas of economic growth that call to you both emotionally and intellectually.</p>
