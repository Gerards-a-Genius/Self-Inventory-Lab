                        <p>No—this is coaching. I combine Human Design, Internal Family Systems (IFS) parts work, and other tools to help you get clear, take action, and lead yourself forward. If you need mental health treatment, I'll recommend working alongside a licensed professional.</p>

                        <p>Yes. Many people begin with a single session or the Insight Mapping System, then decide to continue for deeper, ongoing support. We can talk about what feels right for you after your first experience.</p>
