                        <h4>Do I need to know anything about Human Design or IFS before we work together?</h4>
                        <p>Not at all! I'll teach you everything you need to know as we go. In fact, sometimes it's better to come in with fresh eyes and an open mind.</p>

                        <h4>What if I'm not sure my birth time is accurate?</h4>
                        <p>We'll work with what you have, and there are ways to verify your chart through our conversations. The most important thing is being open to the process.</p>

                        <h4>How is this different from therapy or other coaching?</h4>
                        <p>I combine the practical wisdom of Human Design with the deep healing power of IFS to address both your energetic design AND your internal parts system. This creates embodied transformation, not just intellectual understanding.</p>

                        <h4>What if I don't see results right away?</h4>
                        <p>Transformation is rarely linear. Some people have immediate breakthroughs, others integrate more gradually. I'm committed to supporting you through whatever timeline feels right for you.</p>

                        <p>Absolutely! Many clients start with a single session and then move into longer programs. We can always adjust based on what emerges.</p>

                        <p>Yes! I offer payment plans for the Intensive, 90-Day Container, and Group Pods. Transformation shouldn't be limited by finances.</p>
